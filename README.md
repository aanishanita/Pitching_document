🚀 VentureDraft: AI Business Blueprint Engine
VentureDraft is a high-performance documentation tool designed to turn raw startup concepts into structured, investor-ready business plans in under 60 seconds.
Whether you are launching a liquid organic fertilizer plant or a high-tech agri-venture, this engine kills the weeks of paperwork typically required for a professional pitch.


🌟 What makes this different?
Most AI tools give you "fluff." VentureDraft is built to produce technical blueprints. It doesn't just write a summary; it builds the backbone of your enterprise.
 * 🧪 Technical SOPs: Automatically generates step-by-step Standard Operating Procedures.
 * 📈 Financial Modeling: Calculates Capital Expenditure (CAPEX), Monthly Operating Costs (OPEX), and Benefit-Cost Ratios (BCR).
 * 🛠️ Quality Control: Integrates laboratory and technical validation protocols directly into the plan.
 * ⏳ 20-Week Roadmaps: Provides a granular timeline from setup to market clearance.
 * 🔒 Privacy First: No data ever touches a server. Your business secrets stay in your browser.
🛠️ How it Works
 * Supply the Engine: Paste your Gemini API key (from Google AI Studio).
 * Define the Venture: Describe your business in 2 or 3 lines.
 * Execute: Watch the engine draft a 7-chapter document including financials, risk management, and marketing strategies.
 * Export: Copy the text or download the Markdown file for your formal presentation.
